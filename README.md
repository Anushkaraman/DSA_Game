This project is a collection of interactive visualizers and games that showcase fundamental data structures and algorithms in a fun and engaging way. The repository includes the following games:


**N-Queens Visualizer**
A visualization of the classic N-Queens problem, demonstrating the backtracking algorithm. Users can place queens on the board and visualize the algorithm checking for conflicts. The game features:

Manual placement of queens.
Visualization of the backtracking algorithm.
Highlighting of problematic cells.
A 'Check' button to validate the current board state.


**BST Visualizer**
An interactive Binary Search Tree (BST) visualizer that allows users to:
